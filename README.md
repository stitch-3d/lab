# 🧪 Home Lab

Welcome to my personal **Home Lab** — a hands-on playground for testing applications, experimenting with integrations, and learning more about **Kubernetes**, **DevOps**, and **IT infrastructure** in general.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as the foundation for:
- Spinning up and managing my self-hosted Kubernetes cluster.
- Deploying and testing various open-source tools, apps, and services.
- Learning about container orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, networking, monitoring, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Some of the tools and platforms I'm exploring (or plan to explore) in this lab include:

- **Kubernetes** (K3s / MicroK8s / kubeadm)
- **Docker**
- **Helm**
- **Prometheus + Grafana**
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**
- **Cert-Manager**
- **ArgoCD / FluxCD**
- **Longhorn / Ceph**
- **Keycloak / OAuth2 Proxy**
- and more...

> 📌 As the lab evolves, the structure may expand to include GitOps configs, automation, and more detailed documentation.

## 💡 Goals

- Build a reliable, modular home lab environment
- Understand real-world cloud-native workflows
- Practice infrastructure-as-code and GitOps
- Experiment freely and break things safely 😄

## 🔐 Disclaimer

This is a personal learning environment. While care is taken to follow best practices, configurations here may not be production-grade or secure out-of-the-box. Use at your own risk!
